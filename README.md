*What is Tennisball you may ask?:*

Tennisball is a multi-purpose Discord bot designed for replying to user commands and comments based off memes and furry culture as well as some dog jokes thrown in for shits and giggles.

I Wrote this for my AP (Advanced Placement) Create Project, And yes I intend on turning this in lol. Sure, it's absolute garbage and full of furry jokes, but it's a fun little Discord bot I can lay claim to. ^w^

Funny story about that, so the AP class I took (AP Computer Science Principles) doesn't even teach Javascript. The class is basically 100% Python. Me, being obstinate decided to totally flush that language down the drain and write up the entire project in JS instead. Something about Python just doesn't agree with me, so I just said screw it and wrote it in JS. Oh well, still a great programming language, so I should get a decent score.

This bot is based off the [Discord.JS](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) library, and has little snippets borrowed from the offical documentation (i.e. kicking)

If you have any suggestions, please feel free to message me via email, or Discord. Thanks!
